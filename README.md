    * Energy Production Data: Solar (PV) and Wind generation (target variables).
    * Temporal Features: Season, Day of Week, and Lag Features.
* **Dataset Source:** [Renewable Energy & Electricity Demand Time Series Dataset (Mendeley Data)](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/fdfftr3tc2/1/files/fff037a3-d0e4-496f-92f7-5c5820a734f1)

### 2. Preprocessing Pipeline
The data undergoes a strict chronological pipeline to ensure quality and time-series integrity:
1.  **Load Database:** Ingesting the initial time-series data.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Time Series Conversion, adding temporal features, and creating 70 lag features.
3.  **Outlier Removal:** Using the **Interquartile Range (IQR) Method** to ensure data consistency.
4.  **Normalization:** Applying **MinMaxScaler (Scale to 0-1)** for deep learning readiness.
5.  **Data Splitting:** **70% Training / 30% Testing**. The split is **Chronological** for time series integrity, and a separate Random Shuffling split was also created for multi-output training.

## Model Evolution Pipeline

This project follows a progressive modeling approach, where we systematically assess and evolve the architecture based on the limitations observed in previous models.

### Phase 1: Traditional Machine Learning (Baseline)

| Model | Purpose | Key Limitation Addressed | Discussion Insights |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linear Regression** | Baseline Performance | None (Establishes low-end benchmark) | Chosen for simplicity, but fundamentally unable to capture **non-linear weather patterns** and temporal dependencies. **Failed for wind prediction ($R^2=0.481$)**. |
| **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** | Non-linear Relationships | Non-linearity | Uses the "kernel trick" (RBF Kernel) to model non-linear data. Proven more robust than Linear Regression but still lacked temporal awareness. |

### Phase 2: Ensemble Methods (Strong Non-Temporal Benchmark)

| Model | Purpose | Key Limitation Addressed | Discussion Insights |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Random Forest** (Bagging) | Reduce Variance & Overfitting | High Variance in Single Models | Handled non-linear relationships effectively, achieving drastic improvements. Revealed GHI dominance for solar prediction ($R^2_{PV}=0.983$). |
| **XGBoost** (Boosting) | Reduce Model Bias | High Model Bias | Sequentially corrects errors of previous weak learners. Provided a strong performance benchmark but **still missed crucial temporal sequence patterns**. |

### Phase 3: Deep Learning & Hybrid Architecture

| Model | Purpose | Key Contribution | Discussion Insights |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) | Capture **Temporal Dependencies** | Sequential Nature of Time Series | **Specifically designed for sequential data**. Captured time-based and seasonal patterns effectively, achieving superior wind prediction ($R^2_{Wind}=0.962$) over tree-based models. |
| **CNN + LSTM Hybrid**  | Combine Spatial & Temporal Modeling | Simultaneous Modeling of Local/Long-Term Patterns | Achieved **peak performance** by capturing both local feature patterns (CNN) and long-term dependencies (LSTM) simultaneously. |

### Proposed Hybrid Architecture (CNN-LSTM)

| Component | Function | Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conv1D Layer** (64 filters, kernel=3) | **Spatial Feature Extraction** | Automatically identifies important local patterns and interactions within the weather feature sequences. |
| **MaxPooling1D** (pool\_size=2) | **Dimensionality Reduction** | Reduces the size of the extracted features, making the model more robust and efficient. |
| **LSTM Layer** (64 Units) | **Temporal Sequence Learning** | Processes the filtered sequences over time to understand long-term dependencies and temporal dynamics. |
| **Dropout (0.2)** | **Regularization** | Prevents overfitting during the training of the deep architecture. |
| **Dense Layers** (32 Units) | **Feature Consolidation** | Non-linear mapping and consolidation of the combined spatial and temporal features. |
| **Output Layer** (2 Units, Linear) | **Simultaneous Prediction** | Generates simultaneous predictions for both Solar (PV) and Wind power output. |

## Results and Best Performance

All models were trained using standard deep learning practices (Early Stopping, MSE loss) and evaluated on key metrics including **$R^2$, RMSE, and MAE**.

### Model Performance Summary

| Model | PV $R^2$ | Wind $R^2$ | PV MAE | Wind MAE | Key Takeaway |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Linear Regression | 0.903 | 0.481 | 784.2 | 692.4 | Poorly handles non-linearity; fails for wind. |
| SVR(RBF) | 0.911 | 0.554 | 652.0 | 615.3 | Better non-linearity, but not competitive. |
| Random Forest | 0.983 | 0.946 | 198.8 | 142.2 | Excellent non-temporal performance; struggles with pure time-series. |
| XGBoost | 0.971 | 0.837 | 318.1 | 348.6 | Strong ensemble; better for PV than Wind. |
| LSTM | 0.980 | 0.962 | 506.8 | 188.2 | Superior for Wind, capturing temporal trends. |
| **CNN+LSTM** | **0.983** | **0.965** | 367.7 | **178.5** | **Peak Overall Performance (Highest combined $R^2$)** |

### Final Model Performance (CNN-LSTM)

| Metric | PV Production | Wind Production |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$R^2$ (Coefficient of Determination)** | **$0.983$** | **$0.965$** |
| **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** | $547$ MW | $222$ MW |

This robust performance demonstrates that the CNN-LSTM hybrid model effectively captures both the **spatial feature interactions** and the **long-term temporal patterns** in renewable energy data.

## 💡 The Generative AI Feature: From Data to Actionable Strategy

The core innovation of this project is the integration of a **Natural Language Generation (NLG) engine** with the highly accurate CNN-LSTM forecast. This GenAI feature addresses the crucial social barrier of technical complexity.

### Functionality and Social Impact
The GenAI engine automatically generates localized, plain-language, daily advisories based on the numerical forecast.

| Feature | Description | Social Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Automated Daily Reports** | Translates complex production numbers (e.g., *15 kWh excess PV*) into clear, conversational summaries. | **Empowerment:** Allows non-technical community members to manage complex energy resources confidently. |
| **Actionable Strategy** | Provides concrete advice for energy management (e.g., *"Advise fully charging every battery,"* *"Use stored power for necessities."*) | **Efficiency:** Enables efficient grid charging/discharging, reducing waste and ensuring stable supply. |
| **Accessibility** | The reports can be customized for regional dialects and are suitable for conversion into **voice-based warnings**. | **Inclusivity:** Breaks down barriers of technical literacy and language, ensuring everyone can participate in energy management. |
| **Localization** | The output is adaptable to specific community contexts and resource needs. | **Sustainability:** Directly encourages the uptake and sustained use of clean, local energy systems. |

### Example GenAI Output
> "Good morning! Up until 3 PM today, it will be extremely sunny, producing an excess of 15 kWh. We advise fully charging every battery. Since there won't be much wind after 6 PM, let's simply use the stored power for lights and other necessities."
